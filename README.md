codevember-02 // 2019.11.02 // geometric

30 days, 30 creative experiments. CodeVember is a challenge for developers creating a creative sketch by day during the whole month of November.

## Description
A series of geometric shapes that are tied together in some form.

Shapes will be simple:
- Line
- Triangle
- Square
- Circle

Each shape has connection points where connections to other shapes can form.
- Line: each vertex; midpoint on edge;
- Triangle: each vertex; midpoint on each edge;
- Square: each vertex; midpoint on each edge;
- Circle: each vertex at [ cos(n*PI/4), sin(n*pi/4) ]; where n: 0 ==> 7
